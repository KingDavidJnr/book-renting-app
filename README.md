Here is an example of a simple book renting app implemented in JavaScript:

This code defines a Book class with three attributes: title, author, and available. It also has two methods: rent and return, which allow the user to rent or return a book.

The Library class has two attributes: name and books. It has a single method called search, which searches the library's collection of books for a book with a given title.

The code then creates three Book objects and adds them to an array of books. It also creates a Library object and passes the array of books to its constructor. Finally, it searches for a book, rents and returns a book, and attempts to rent a book that is not available.
